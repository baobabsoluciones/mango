Genetic Algorithms (GA)
-----------------------

This section of the documentation covers the module dedicated to genetic algorithms. The main objective is to give an overview of how this algorithms work, the current genetic operators implemented and how to use this module to solve problems or quickly prototype solutions.

Each of these sections should cover in enough detail the different aspects of the genetic algorithms implemented in this module. The last section, usage, will cover how to use the module with some code examples.

.. note::
    This module is still under development and some of the features described in this documentation may not be implemented yet. If you find any bug or have any suggestion, please, open an issue in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/baobabsoluciones/mango>`_.
