    """
    Compute the Egg-holder function value for optimization benchmarking.

    The Egg-holder function has many widespread local minima, which are regularly
    distributed. This function is particularly challenging for optimization algorithms
    due to its complex landscape with numerous local optima and steep gradients.

    The function is usually evaluated on the square xi âˆˆ [-512, 512], for all i = 1, 2.
    The global minimum is located at x = (512, 404.2319) with a value of -959.6407.

    :return: Function value at the given point
    :rtype: float
    :raises ValueError: If input array doesn't have exactly 2 elements
    :raises IndexError: If input array is empty
