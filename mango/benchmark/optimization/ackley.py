    General Ackley function.

    The Ackley function is widely used for testing optimization algorithms.

    In its two-dimensional form, it is characterized by a nearly flat outer region, and a large hole at the centre.
    The function poses a risk for optimization algorithms, particularly hillclimbing algorithms,
    to be trapped in one of its many local minima.

    The global minimum point of the function is: f(x) = 0, at x = (0, ..., 0)
